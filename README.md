## Problem Statement

The Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository contains a large amount of data related to various metrics and statistics. Our aim is to extract this data and process it to obtain insights and information that can be visualized in a user-friendly manner.

### Solution Steps:

1. **Data Extraction**: We'll clone the GitHub repository using scripting to fetch the data and store it.
2. **Data Transformation**: Using Python and Pandas, we'll clean and preprocess the data.
3. **Database Insertion**: We'll insert the transformed data into a MySQL database for efficient storage and retrieval.
4. **Dashboard Creation**: Using Streamlit and Plotly, we'll create an interactive dashboard to display the data.
5. **Data Retrieval**: We'll fetch data from the MySQL database to display in the dashboard.
6. **User Interface**: Providing dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures to display on the dashboard.

## Approach

Our approach involves the following steps:

1. **Data Extraction**: Scripting to fetch data from GitHub repository.
2. **Data Transformation**: Using Python and Pandas for data cleaning and preprocessing.
3. **Database Insertion**: Utilizing mysql-connector-python to insert data into MySQL.
4. **Dashboard Creation**: Creating an interactive dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly.
5. **Data Retrieval**: Fetching data from MySQL using mysql-connector-python.
6. **Deployment**: Ensuring security, efficiency, and user-friendliness, then deploying the dashboard publicly.

## Results

The result will be a live geo visualization dashboard displaying insights from the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository. Users can access the dashboard from a web browser and navigate different visualizations and facts. The dashboard will provide valuable insights and information, making it a valuable tool for data analysis and decision-making.
